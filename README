The simple_website_scanner is just that...a simple website scanner.
You provide it the hostname of a website (www.cnn.com) for example, and it
will return the following:
	- IP address
	- Address type (IPv4/IPv6)
	- Address length
	- Alternate IP addresses
	- Alternate hostnames (aliases)
	- Webserver
It will only display information it can retrieve. Therefore, if there are no
aliases, it will ignore this section entirely in the output.

**Notes:
1.) The webserver portion does not work properly on every website. The way I
	retrieve this information isn't exactly ideal. Help would be appreciat	      ed.
2.) There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the hacking-network.h file. I
	did not write this file and haven't had time to write my own.
